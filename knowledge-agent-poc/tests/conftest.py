Speaker: Dr. Alice Chen
Date: January 2026
Duration: 45 minutes

[00:00] Introduction
Today we're going to talk about building knowledge extraction systems using modern AI techniques.
The problem we're solving is extracting structured knowledge from unstructured research artifacts.

[05:00] The Challenge
Research papers, talks, and code repositories contain valuable knowledge that's locked in unstructured formats.
Current approaches require manual curation, which doesn't scale.

[10:00] Our Approach
We developed a multi-agent system that can extract knowledge from three types of artifacts:
1. Research papers (PDFs)
2. Research talks (transcripts)
3. Code repositories (GitHub)

[15:00] Technical Details
The system uses language models with specialized prompts for each artifact type.
Each agent produces a standardized JSON output with 12 baseline knowledge fields.

[20:00] Results
In our pilot, we extracted knowledge from 100 artifacts with an average quality score of 3.8/5.0.
The system handles edge cases like incomplete papers and non-English transcripts.

[30:00] Challenges
One major challenge was prompt engineering - getting the LLM to extract the right information.
Another was handling PDFs that couldn't be parsed due to image-based content.

[40:00] Future Work
We plan to add support for blog posts, video transcripts, and internal documentation.
We're also exploring knowledge graph integration to link findings across artifacts.

[45:00] Q&A
Questions from the audience about implementation details and deployment.
