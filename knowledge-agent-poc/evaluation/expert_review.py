# Expert Review Instructions

Review the extracted knowledge artifact across 5 dimensions:

## 1. Factual Accuracy (1-5)
- Are claims supported by the source material?
- Are technical details correct and precise?
- Are citations and references accurate?
- Is there any hallucination or extrapolation?

Score:
- 5: All facts verified, no inaccuracies
- 4: Mostly accurate, minor issues
- 3: Generally accurate, some concerns
- 2: Several inaccuracies present
- 1: Major factual errors

## 2. Completeness (1-5)
- Are all required baseline fields populated?
- Are datatype-specific fields thoroughly extracted?
- Is the additional_knowledge section explored?
- Are there obvious gaps in coverage?

Score:
- 5: Comprehensive, all key info captured
- 4: Mostly complete, minor gaps
- 3: Acceptable coverage, some gaps
- 2: Several important omissions
- 1: Major gaps in coverage

## 3. Faithfulness to Source (1-5)
- Does extraction stay true to source material?
- Are there unwarranted interpretations?
- Is provenance clearly tracked?
- Are confidence levels appropriate?

Score:
- 5: Perfect fidelity to source
- 4: High fidelity, minor liberties
- 3: Acceptable fidelity, some extrapolation
- 2: Notable deviations from source
- 1: Poor fidelity, significant extrapolation

## 4. Signal-to-Noise Ratio (1-5)
- Is information high-value and actionable?
- Is there unnecessary verbosity?
- Are key insights clearly highlighted?
- Is the extraction concise yet complete?

Score:
- 5: Perfect signal, no noise
- 4: High signal, minimal noise
- 3: Acceptable ratio, some fluff
- 2: Noisy with diluted insights
- 1: Low signal, mostly noise

## 5. Reusability for AI (1-5)
- Is extraction well-structured for AI consumption?
- Are fields properly typed and formatted?
- Is metadata sufficient for retrieval?
- Can an AI easily parse and use this?

Score:
- 5: Perfectly structured for AI
- 4: Well-structured, minor improvements possible
- 3: Acceptable structure, some issues
- 2: Poor structure, needs work
- 1: Unusable for AI without major rework

## Overall Assessment
- Calculate average score across 5 dimensions
- Minimum passing: 3.0/5.0
- Recommend iteration if below threshold
